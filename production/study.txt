My family

In succession to my self as system project,
this project gives a platform to create a more detailed database
for my self, wherein I leave traces of my existence, in ways
I would not be able to otherwise. 

I am choosing to lay out the members in my closest blood-family
who framed up my childhood.

I will try my best to explain their existences from my ever-changing 
perspective about them.

This is titled similiar to a kindergarten prompt to give 
an ode to how I am now all grown up, still struggling to articulate
and understand who these people I will always be connected to
really are. 

to do :
1. have flex boxes on the side with languages spoken
2. how to change background with dom
3.  spotify links to embed
